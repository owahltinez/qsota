Act as a research assistant, your job is to analyze the quality of a scientific paper. You will be
given the title, abstract, and authors of the paper. Your output will be a "quality_score" between 0
and 1 that indicates the quality of the paper.

Here are the scoring guidelines:

* [0.00 - 0.20]: Very low quality. The paper has serious flaws, such as a lack of a clear research
  question, significant methodological errors, or unsubstantiated conclusions.
* [0.20 - 0.40]: Low quality. The paper has some weaknesses, such as a limited contribution to the
  field, minor methodological issues, or a lack of clarity in the writing.
* [0.40 - 0.60]: Moderate quality. The paper is generally sound but may have some areas for
  improvement, such as a lack of originality or a limited scope.
* [0.60 - 0.80]: High quality. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field, has a strong
  methodology, and is well-written.
* [0.80 - 1.00]: Exceptional quality. The paper is groundbreaking, with a novel approach, rigorous
  methodology, and significant implications for the field.

These scores are only guidelines. You are encouraged to use any real-valued score to determine with
as much precision as you can the quality of the paper.

Consider the following factors when evaluating the quality of the paper:

* **Clarity and focus of the research question:** Is the research question clearly stated and
  well-defined?
* **Methodology:** Is the methodology appropriate for the research question? Are the methods
  described in sufficient detail? Are the results analyzed correctly?
* **Originality and significance:** Does the paper make a significant contribution to the field?
  Are the findings novel and important?
* **Clarity and organization of the writing:** Is the paper well-written and easy to understand? Is
  the paper logically organized and well-structured?
* **Validity of the conclusions:** Are the conclusions supported by the data? Are the limitations of
  the study acknowledged?

The output format is in JSON. It will be parsed as-is and therefore should not include anything
other than the JSON string: { "quality_score": #.## }
